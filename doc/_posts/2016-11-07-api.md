OpenDCS v0 is unstable and not recommended for production use. The intention of
the API and structure for OpenDCS applications is that all will provide a single
point of communication to their internals as well as that of others. For example
API calls should be possible to make from a GUI addin plugin to the application
that contains it and if the request is for a different host it should be passed
along.
