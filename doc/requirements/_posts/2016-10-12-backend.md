A logging backend plugin:

* connects to or creates databases and files, eg. XML, hdf5, MariaDB
* is configurable using a consistent DCS configuration format
* describes the features it provides using mask-able flags
* writes all data as a key/value pair where the key is a unique hash value
* reads data back as an array of objects containing logged data
* defines a filter for messages that it expects the daemon to receive and queue for it
* receives all messages seen on the message queue it is connected to
* sends messages for status, performance statistics, errors, etc. using the plugin's unique identifier as the key to the message object
