<!--
The following is a high level list of requirements that should be addressed in a
System Specification:

Define the functions of the system
Define the Hardware / Software Functional Partitioning
Define the Performance Specification
Define the Hardware / Software Performance Partitioning
Define Safety Requirements
Define the User Interface (A good user's manual is often an overlooked part of
the System specification. Many of our customers haven't even considered that
this is the right time to write the user's manual.)
Provide Installation Drawings/Instructions.
Provide Interface Control Drawings (ICD's, External I/O)
